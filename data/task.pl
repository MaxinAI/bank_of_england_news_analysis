I have attached statements from the Bank of England since 2017. We are looking for the bank rate and the quantative easing number. In the text:

THE MPC VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO INCREASE BANK RATE BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS, TO 0.75%. THE COMMITTEE VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO MAINTAIN THE STOCK OF STERLING NON-FINANCIAL INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BOND PURCHASES, FINANCED BY THE ISSUANCE OF CENTRAL BANK RESERVES, AT STG 10 BILLION. THE COMMITTEE ALSO VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO MAINTAIN THE STOCK OF UK GOVERNMENT BOND PURCHASES, FINANCED BY THE ISSUANCE OF CENTRAL BANK RESERVES, AT STG 435 BILLION.

the important numbers are 0.75% in the first sentence and 435 Billion in the last sentence.

We can almost use straightforward pattern matching for these, such as finding the first percentage in a sentence after the words "BANK RATE", but it would increase our confidence in correctness if we knew that 0.75% referred to the bank rate and did not just happen to be some other percentage in a sentence that also had the words "BANK RATE", such as

VOTED TO RAISE THE BANK RATE BECAUSE OF 2.5% UNEMPLOYMENT

This is intended not to be a big project. If it will take more than a week, we should discuss first to understand what we are getting into.
